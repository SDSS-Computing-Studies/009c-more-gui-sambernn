##### Task 1
Heron's method is a way of calculating the area of a triangle if all 
3 sides are known but you don't know the height of the triangle.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heron%27s_formula#Formulation

The formula is A = sqrt(s(s-a)(s-b)s-c))
where a, b, c are the sides of the triangle, and s is given by:
s = (a+b+c)/2

Create a program that calculates the area of a triangle using the
entryboxes (in task1.png).  If they have enough information to use the
typical triangle area formula (A = b*h/2) then use that, otherwise
calculate the area using Heron's formula.  If that is insufficient,
tell the user that the area cannot be calculated from the information 
given.
